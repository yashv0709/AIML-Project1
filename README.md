# AIML-Project1
PROJECT NAME: Movie Recommendation System Objective: Suggest movies based on user preferences using ML. Tools: Python, Pandas, Sklearn, Streamlit.

Project Description:

The Movie Recommendation System is an intelligent application designed to suggest movies tailored to user preferences using machine learning techniques. By leveraging the MovieLens dataset, the system preprocesses and analyzes user ratings and movie metadata to build both collaborative and content-based filtering models. It offers personalized top 5 movie recommendations through a user-friendly Streamlit interface. The project also includes optional sentiment-based filtering using reviews to enhance recommendation quality.

Steps Followed: 1.Import required libraries: Python, Pandas, Sklearn, Streamlit. 2.Load the MovieLens dataset (movies.csv and ratings.csv). 3.Preprocess and clean the data (merge, handle nulls, format). 4.Build a collaborative filtering model using similarity scores. 5.Implement content-based filtering using genres and metadata. 6.Create a user interface using Streamlit to take inputs. 7.Return top 5 recommended movies based on the selected model. 8.Deliver the project as a Jupyter notebook with Streamlit UI and logic code.

Data sets used:

movies.csv
ratings.csv
